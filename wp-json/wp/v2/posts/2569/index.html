They also involve being sensible about non-capacitance, non-charge, non-current, non-resistivity, and non-power. Additionally, they require sustainability in terms of non-infinity, non-intensity, non-density, non-resistance, and non-conductivity. Furthermore, accessibility to non-probability, non-correlation, non-curvature, non-clustering, and non-causality is necessary. Finally, capability in terms of non-potential action, non-kinetic action, non-radiant action, non-thermal action, and non-chemical action is also required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example Practices<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personal: Being flexible and adaptable to different situations and people<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Professional: Being open to new ideas and ways of working<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Family: Being understanding and supportive of family members&#8217; needs and feelings<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social: Being respectful and considerate of others&#8217; opinions and beliefs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways to grow our conscience, including meditation, yoga, and mindfulness. In addition to these, cultivating gratitude and forgiveness can also help us develop a stronger sense of empathy and compassion towards ourselves and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good Times of Conscience Practice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we practice conscience, we can experience a greater sense of fulfillment and contentment with our actions and decisions. It allows us to live more intentionally and make choices that align with our values and beliefs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigating our conscience can lead to new insights and perspectives on life. By reflecting on our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good Life of Conscience Mimesis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in accordance with our conscience can lead to a good life, one that is free from the afflictions of ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life. By living in a way that aligns with our values and beliefs, we can experience greater peace and harmony within ourselves and with those around us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inheriting a strong sense of conscience can lead to a good life that involves not only practicing self-restraint in actions such as abstaining from violence, falsehoods, stealing, and sexual misconduct, but also actively seeking opportunities to help others and make a positive impact on the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Episode 2 discusses the importance and benefits of practicing and investigating one&#8217;s conscience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2540,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"","_seopress_titles_title":"","_seopress_titles_desc":"","_seopress_robots_index":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[219,222],"tags":[185,213],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2569"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2569"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2569\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2540"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2569"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2569"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2569"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
