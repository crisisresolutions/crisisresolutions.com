It&#8217;s the ability to build and maintain strong relationships with diverse groups of people (such as family, friends, colleagues or neighbors) that can provide us with emotional support, practical help or guidance. Having a flexible community means being open to different perspectives, cultures and values, and being able to adapt to changing situations and needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is flexibility of community important? Well, research shows that having a strong social network can improve our mental and physical health, reduce stress and increase happiness. It can also help us cope with crises by providing us with resources, information and emotional support. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people relied on their communities to stay connected, informed and hopeful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we develop flexibility of community? Here are some tips based on our website <a href=\"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">crisisresolutions.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be proactive. Don&#8217;t wait for others to reach out to you; take the initiative to contact them regularly and show interest in their lives. You can also join groups or organizations that share your interests or values, or volunteer for a cause that you care about.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be respectful. Recognize that everyone has their own opinions, beliefs and preferences, and avoid judging them based on your own standards. Listen actively and empathetically to what they have to say, and try to understand their point of view. You don&#8217;t have to agree with everything they say or do; you just have to respect their right to be different.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be supportive. Offer help when you can, and ask for help when you need it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to express your feelings or concerns; your community is there for you. Also, celebrate your achievements and successes together; sharing positive emotions can strengthen your bonds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be flexible. Understand that people&#8217;s circumstances and needs may change over time; be ready to adjust your expectations accordingly. Don&#8217;t take things personally if someone cancels plans or doesn&#8217;t reply right away; they may have other priorities or challenges at the moment. Also, be open to meeting new people and expanding your network; diversity can enrich your life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility of community is not something that happens overnight; it takes time and effort to cultivate it. But it&#8217;s worth it because it can make a huge difference in how we deal with crises and how we enjoy life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all for today&#8217;s episode; thank you for listening!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to build and maintain strong relationships with diverse groups of people (such as family, friends, colleagues or neighbors) that can provide us with emotional support, practical help or guidance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2780,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[221,219],"tags":[214,185],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2794"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2794"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2794\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2780"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2794"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2794"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2794"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
