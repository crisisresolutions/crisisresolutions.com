When experienced as Forward Movement (as when we walk), it is expressed as Diversity. This Diversity concerns matters of Inclusion and Fitness, as a result of Leftward and Rightward Movements respectively (as when our brain hemispheres share different responsibilities). Backward Movements are associated with the ability to Party (as when we stay still), and Downward with Wellbeing (as when we lay down and rest).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Definitions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexibility<\/strong>: The ability to adjust and adapt to changing circumstances or conditions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Freedom<\/strong>: The power or being oneself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diversity<\/strong>: The state of being varied and made up of different elements or types.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inclusion<\/strong>: The action or state of including or of being included within a group or structure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fitness<\/strong>: The condition of being generally fit and healthy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Party<\/strong>: A Group or an organized social gathering.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wellbeing<\/strong>: The state of being fulfilled and happy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2.

Then, through cooperation in matters of accessibility levels empowerment, topics support, recipes composition, journals documentation, challenges adaptation, and rituals coexistence we can refine our capability for self-reflection genesis, sentience practice, self-autonomy mimesis, simplicity growth, symmetry investigation, and variety inheritance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mental Good Ways are methods related to our Conscience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3470,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"","_seopress_titles_title":"","_seopress_titles_desc":"","_seopress_robots_index":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[218],"tags":[212,184,211],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2460"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2460"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2460\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3470"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2460"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2460"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2460"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
