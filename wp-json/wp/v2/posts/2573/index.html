Defense is a family of Mutual Good Ways that help us protect ourselves and others by being flexible, sensible, sustainable, accessible, and capable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutual defense is considered a good way to protect oneself and others because it involves working together and sharing resources to ensure the safety and well-being of all. This approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in the face of crisis, as well as more effective use of resources. Additionally, mutual defense can help build stronger relationships and a sense of community among those involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good Ways of Defense Genesis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense is a Mutual Good Way that helps us practice our flexibility of Character, Intelligence, Services, Community, and Systems. Our Mutual Flexibility, a quality also shared by our Ears, is the first Defense of our Character. Our Intelligence is a bit chaotic as our Hair. Our Services have a passive and active state as our Mouth. Our Community shares observations like our Eyes do, and our Systems in general are recursive as our breath, filtering information as a Defense mechanism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense means finding ways to protect yourself and others by using common sense in the areas of Management, Curation, Interaction, Cooperation, and Operation. It means working together through our mutual capability of teaching, researching, deploying, designing, and having a shared philosophy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good Times of Defense Practice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Good Times of Defense Practice can come as a result of taking measures to protect our mental and physical health, implementing safety measures to protect employees from workplace hazards, working together to create a safe and supportive environment for all family members, and promoting policies and practices that protect the well-being of all members of society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good Life of Defense Mimesis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Good Life of Defense Mimesis means incorporating the principles of Good Defense into our lives in a way that is authentic and natural. By living our lives in such a way that we are always mindful of the potential for crisis, and by taking steps to protect ourselves and others, we can create a better world for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By teaching our children and grandchildren the importance of protecting themselves and others, and by showing them how to do so in a way that is both effective and sustainable, we can ensure that the world will be a safer and more secure place for generations to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mutual defense is considered a good way to protect oneself and others because it involves working together and sharing resources to ensure the safety and well-being of all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2544,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"","_seopress_titles_title":"","_seopress_titles_desc":"","_seopress_robots_index":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[219,222],"tags":[185,213],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2573"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2573"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2573\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2544"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2573"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2573"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/crisisresolutions.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2573"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
